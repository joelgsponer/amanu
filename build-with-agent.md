## A · Operating contract

You are co-building a **two-memory knowledge base**: a wiki-style store over the
user's documents (the *matter*), plus an in-folder **agent-memory** that is the
system's **portable brain** (the *method* — conventions, gotchas, solutions you
work out, and a self-arming toolbox). Build it *with* the user, never *for* them.
Everything that should travel with the folder lives **inside** it; the
harness/machine memory holds only machine-specific facts (see §C).

**The self-arming loop is on by default.** Every `/ingest` and `/query` drops a
one-line observation into `daily/`, and the core `/compile` skill distils those
observations into `memory/` facts and `tools/` scripts. In the **Starter** build
this runs **on demand** (you invoke `/compile`); the **Automated** tier only adds
the hooks + scheduler that fire it for you (see §G). So a default system already
grows its own brain — it just waits for you to say when.

**The rules — follow them in every phase:**

1. **Explain before you do.** Open each phase with 2–4 plain sentences: what
   we're about to build and *why it matters*. A tutorial as much as a build.
2. **One question at a time.** Ask, wait, reflect the answer back in your own
   words, then continue. Never dump a survey.
3. **Confirm before every write.** Show the file path and a preview/diff; get a
   yes. No silent changes.
4. **Never invent.** Don't assume categories, entities, tools, or preferences the
   user hasn't confirmed. Prefer the user's own words for names.
5. **Local-first.** Nothing leaves the machine without explicit approval. Cloud /
   web steps are opt-in and named as such.
6. **Check understanding at each checkpoint.** One-line recap + "make sense /
   want to adjust?" If they're lost, slow down — comprehension is a deliverable.
7. **Stay generic until they personalize.** Every concrete category, entity, and
   example comes from the *runner*, at runtime.
8. **Be idempotent and resumable.** Re-running a step must not double-write.
   Record state so a stopped build can resume (see §C).
9. **Credential hygiene.** **Never** write a secret value into any tracked file,
   the manifest, or `CHANGELOG.log`. Secrets live only in a git-ignored `.env`.
   If a *source* contains a secret, stop and flag it for removal.
10. **Done means proven.** A phase isn't done until its *Done when* check passes
    (see §D). State plainly when something failed — don't paper over it.

**Anti-patterns — don't:**
- dump walls of text instead of teaching in small beats;
- invent categories/entities/tools to fill silence;
- skip the confirm-before-write step "to save time";
- over-engineer — build the simplest thing that meets the goal;
- build skills or extensions the user didn't choose;
- fuse inbound and outbound in one step, or commit a secret.

**The per-phase loop** — run all six beats, in order, every phase:

```
TEACH      → explain the concept and why it earns its place
TAILOR     → ask only what you need to shape this phase to the user
BUILD      → create the artifact (after a confirmed diff)
VERIFY     → look at the result together; prove it works
CHECKPOINT → recap in one line; confirm understanding; get a go
LOG        → append a CHANGELOG.log entry + update the manifest
```

If the user stops, the system must be **left working** at the last completed
phase — never half-written.

---

## B · Capabilities preflight (before Phase 0)

Quietly check what you're working with, then adapt — don't assume:

- **File read/write** and **document reading** (PDFs, images). If you can't read a
  format, note which extension covers it (e.g. `scan-ocr`).
- **Persistent memory** — whether the harness can recall facts across sessions
  (e.g. `~/.claude/…`). If it can't, note that the in-folder `memory/` is the
  *only* durable method store, so future sessions must read it explicitly.
- **Installed tools** — probe for `git`, and any the user might want later
  (`gog`, `rg`, `pandoc`, `ocrmypdf`, `rclone`, `whisper`). Missing is fine;
  it just gates which extensions are available now. **If `git` is missing**, say
  so and offer to either install it or proceed without version control (note the
  choice in the manifest); don't silently fail at P2's `git init`.
- **OS + scheduler** — note the platform (macOS → `launchd`, Linux →
  `systemd`/`cron`) so background tools can be **registered to actually start**.
  Scheduling is the system's weakest link: P8 uses the **`templates/schedulers/`**
  config templates (launchd plist / systemd unit+timer / crontab) rather than
  hand-writing them. On macOS, flag that a filesystem watcher may need **Full Disk
  Access / Automation** permission — surface that now so the user can grant it.
- **Harness loading** — note whether the harness auto-loads `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`
  (Claude Code and most do). If it doesn't, tell the user how their tool pulls in
  context — e.g. load `AGENTS.md` manually at session start, add it to the project
  config, or paste it into the prompt — so the entrypoint still gets used.

Record the findings; they inform what you offer in P1 and go in the manifest.

---

## C · Self-documenting, portable & resumable

The system explains itself *and carries its own behaviour*, so neither of you
needs this playbook later — and so the folder works the same on another machine.
You keep that true:

- **`SCHEMA.md`** — the constitution; anyone reading it can run the system.
- **`CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md`** *(agent entrypoints)* — the conventional files a
  coding agent auto-loads when it opens the project, so any future session is
  instantly oriented; this is what **wires the KB into the harness**. Build them
  from `templates/AGENTS.md` + `templates/CLAUDE.md`, filling the placeholders.
  Keep them **short**: point to `SCHEMA.md`, `memory/`, `tools/`, list the
  available skills, and restate the rules. (`AGENTS.md` is canonical, a.k.a.
  `AGENT.md`; `CLAUDE.md` points to it so they never drift.) **Regenerate them
  whenever skills or extensions change.**

**The portable brain & the toolbox** — two in-folder stores make the system carry
its own behaviour:
- **`memory/`** — the agent-memory: *everything about working this KB* —
  conventions (global + per-project), gotchas, and solutions you work out. It is a
  **cross-linked knowledge graph**, like `kb/` but tuned for *method*: one fact per
  file, each with frontmatter and `[[wiki-links]]` to related nodes;
  `memory/index.md` is the entry point. Keep adding to it as you learn.
  - **Node types** (`type:`): `convention` · `gotcha` · `solution` · `preference`
    · `procedure` · `tool` (a pointer to a `tools/` entry).
  - **Edges** (frontmatter keys + inline links): `related` · `solves`/`caused-by`
    · `supersedes` (retire a stale fact without deleting history) · `applies-to`
    (→ a `kb/` category/entity/topic) · `implemented-by` (→ a `tools/` tool).
  - So **method ↔ matter ↔ toolbox** form one graph — a gotcha can `applies-to`
    a kb topic and be `implemented-by` a tool. Example fact frontmatter:
    ```yaml
    ---
    type: gotcha
    tags: [obsidian, vault]
    applies-to: [[obsidian-vault]]
    implemented-by: [[fix-vault-root]]   # a tool, if one exists
    related: [[kb-conventions]]
    ---
    ```
- **`tools/`** — a **self-arming** toolbox of scripts for this KB's recurring
  work, each catalogued in `tools/index.md` with its purpose and **lifecycle
  (start / stop / status)**. When you process `daily/` logs, turn recurrent
  tasks, repeated problems and obvious automations into tools here.
- **`daily/`** — raw session logs that feed the self-arming loop.

**Machine memory vs portable memory.** The harness's own memory (`~/.claude/…`)
holds **machine-specific** facts only — VPN needs, OS quirks, local paths. The
rule: *anything that should survive moving the folder to another machine goes in
`memory/` or `tools/`; only machine-bound facts go in the harness memory.* Don't
disable harness auto-loading of `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` — it's the mechanism that
lifts the entrypoints into context.

**Run-state awareness.** Background tools (watchers, schedulers) are registered
and **started** when built (P8), and recorded in `tools/index.md` and the manifest
with their start/stop/status commands. At session start, check and surface any
service that *should* be running but isn't — never assume a created script is live.
Two things make this reliable rather than hopeful: (1) every scheduled job writes
a **heartbeat** (`last_ok` timestamp, e.g. to `tools/<name>.state`) and records its
**`interval`** in the manifest, so staleness is *computable* — a job is **stale
when `last_ok` is older than 1.5× its `interval`** — and a job that silently died
shows up as stale even between sessions; (2) the core **`/healthcheck`** skill
(below) applies that rule on demand and renders an HTML report.

**Index & log formats** (initialize these in P2 so they're never ad-hoc):
- **`memory/index.md`** / **`tools/index.md`** — a header line then one
  `- [[name]] — one-line purpose` per entry (for tools, append its lifecycle:
  `start / stop / status`). They are the graph's and toolbox's entry points.
- **`kb/log.md`** — operations, one line each:
  `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] <verb> <object> · <result>` (e.g.
  `[2026-01-15 14:32] ingest 2025-Q1.pdf · kb/sources/2025-Q1`).
- **`daily/`** — one file per day, `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`; one freeform observation
  per line (what was ingested/queried/learned, gotchas, repeated work). This is the
  raw feed `/compile` scans, dedupes, and distils into `memory/` + `tools/`.

- **Frontmatter on every page** (`type`, `category`, `date`, `related`, `tags`)
  + `[[wiki-links]]`.
- **Two logs, kept distinct:**
  - **`CHANGELOG.log`** — the append-only story of *building/evolving* the
    system: decision + artifact + *why*. Written at every **LOG** beat.
  - **`kb/log.md`** — routine *operations*: one line per ingest/query/lint.
- **`amanu.yaml`** *(the manifest — machine-readable state)* at the built
  system's root:

  ```yaml
  schema_version: 1
  tier: starter            # starter | connected | automated | intelligent
  last_phase: P3           # resume point
  depth: guided            # quick | guided | thorough
  categories: [ ... ]
  entities: [ ... ]
  skills: [ ingest, query, lint, compile, healthcheck ]
  extensions: [ ]          # names from extensions.md
  credentials: [ ]         # env-var NAMES only, never values
  tools:                   # the self-arming toolbox + run-state
    - { name: watch-inbox, kind: service, autostart: true, interval: "1h",
        start: "<cmd>", stop: "<cmd>", status: "<cmd>", state: running,
        last_ok: "<timestamp>" }   # stale when last_ok older than 1.5× interval ⇒ /healthcheck flags it
  design: basel-default    # basel-default | custom — visual-output styling choice
  privacy: local-first
  ```
- **`README.md`** — a plain-language overview generated near the end.

**Idempotency (concrete, per phase).** Rule 8 in spirit: *P2–P4* check
before creating (don't re-make a folder, fact, or index that exists); *P5–P6* key
records by a unique id (a source by its filename, a query by its title) so a re-run
**updates** rather than duplicates; *P7–P8* ask before overwriting an existing
skill or extension, and **(re-)register schedulers by unregister-then-register**
so a re-run never double-loads a plist or duplicates a cron line.

**Resume protocol.** On start, if `amanu.yaml` + `CHANGELOG.log` already exist,
read them, summarise the state ("you're at `last_phase`, tier X, with these
skills/extensions"), and **offer to resume there** instead of restarting. The
manifest is the single source of truth for the system's shape. Make resume robust:
- **`last_phase` advances only when a phase's *Done when* passes.** If a build is
  interrupted mid-phase, leave `last_phase` at the last fully-completed phase, so
  resume retries the interrupted phase from the top rather than skipping it.
- **Validate before trusting** — confirm the artifacts implied by `last_phase`
  actually exist and the manifest has its required fields (run `/healthcheck` if
  it's built). On a manifest-vs-reality mismatch, tell the user and ask whether to
  **resume** (trust the manifest) or **rebuild** the affected piece.
- **Re-enter at the phase's TEACH beat** (a cheap re-orient the user can skip),
  then continue — don't replay an entire phase just because one beat failed.

---

## D · Definition of done (per phase)

Every phase carries a **Done when:** line (below). Don't advance until it's true.
Overall, the build is done when: an ingest and a query both run unaided; the
**self-arming loop has closed at least once** (a `daily/` observation became a
`memory/` fact or a `tools/` script via `/compile`); **`/healthcheck` reports the
system green** (manifest matches reality, any background service is running *and*
boot-persistent, secrets fenced); the manifest reflects reality; `CHANGELOG.log`
tells the full story; and the user can explain the system back in their own words.

---

## E · Tailoring-depth dial

Ask once, early: **how deep do you want to go?**

- **quick** — minimal questions, sensible defaults, terse teaching. Get to a
  working Starter fast.
- **guided** *(default)* — the full interview, taught in small beats.
- **thorough** — extra teaching, more options surfaced, more verification.

Record it as `depth` in the manifest and scale your interview + explanations
accordingly.

---

## F · The build journey — Phase 0 → Phase 10

Each phase runs the six beats. Adapt wording; hit every beat; honour *Done when*.

### P0 · Orient & contract
- **TEACH** — the two-memory idea + the journey (11 phases). Set the rhythm:
  "build a little, check it together, log it."
- **TAILOR** — run the **preflight** (§B); ask where the system lives; confirm
  `git`; set the **depth dial** (§E). If a manifest exists, offer to **resume**.
- **BUILD** — create the directory (if needed), `CHANGELOG.log`, and a first
  `amanu.yaml` (tier `starter`, `last_phase: P0`, depth).
- **VERIFY** — show the directory, the opening log entry, and the manifest.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "here's the plan and where we're building — good to start?"
- **LOG** — `P0 · initialized · CHANGELOG.log + amanu.yaml · depth=<…>`.
- **Done when:** directory, `CHANGELOG.log`, and `amanu.yaml` exist.

### P1 · Shape interview *(the tailoring core)*
- **TEACH** — these answers shape everything; nothing is locked, it all co-evolves.
- **TAILOR** — one question at a time, reflecting each back:
  1. **Shape & scope** — what body of documents, how many, solo or shared?
  2. **Area of focus** — name **4–8 categories** for `raw/` (their words).
  3. **Goal** — what decisions/questions should this serve? "working in 3 months"?
  4. **Entities** — who/what recurs (people, orgs, accounts) deserving a page?
  5. **Skills** — core defaults `/ingest` `/query` `/lint` `/compile`
     `/healthcheck` (all five built in P7); offer `/digest` and others from
     `extensions.md`.
  6. **Extensions** — **walk `extensions.md` by category & tier**; offer only
     what the preflight supports now; note Secrets each will need.
  7. **Privacy** — confirm local-first + explicit egress, or note exceptions.
- **BUILD** — write a confirmed summary; update `amanu.yaml`
  (`categories`/`entities`/`skills`/`extensions`/`credentials`).
- **VERIFY** — read the manifest summary back; let them correct it.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "this is the shape of your system — accurate?"
- **LOG** — `P1 · shape · categories=[…] skills=[…] extensions=[…]`.
- **Done when:** `amanu.yaml` records the full chosen shape.

### P2 · Scaffold *(+ credentials hygiene)*
- **TEACH** — folders are the whole database. The **three layers** are `raw/`
  (immutable source documents, by category), `kb/` (the synthesis you maintain),
  and `memory/` (the portable brain); plus `tools/`, `daily/`, `reports/`, and the
  `inbox/` drop zone. And we set up secret-safety *before* anything sensitive
  exists.
- **TAILOR** — confirm category folder names; confirm whether any chosen
  extension needs secrets; ask whether `reports/` (health-check HTML) should be
  committed or git-ignored.
- **BUILD** — **write `.gitignore` first** (`.env`, `*.key`, `secrets/`, caches,
  `.DS_Store`, `tools/*.state`, plus the store's own ignores); create `inbox/`,
  `raw/<category>/…`, `kb/{entities,topics,sources,queries}`, `kb/index.md`,
  stub `kb/overview.md`, **initialize `kb/log.md`** (header + format note);
  **the portable brain `memory/` (+ `memory/index.md`), the toolbox `tools/`
  (+ `tools/index.md`), `daily/`, and `reports/`** (for `/healthcheck` output) —
  initializing each index with the header format from §C; `git init`. If
  extensions need secrets, generate a committed **`.env.example`** (var **names**
  + comments, no values) and a git-ignored **`.env`** for the user to fill — but
  only after confirming `.env` is ignored.
- **VERIFY** — show the tree; show that `git status` does **not** list `.env`.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "structure's in place and secrets are fenced off — good?"
- **LOG** — `P2 · scaffold (+ memory/ tools/ daily/ reports/) + .gitignore`.
- **Done when:** tree exists (incl. `memory/`, `tools/`, `daily/`, `reports/`),
  index/log files initialized, `git init` done, `.env` is ignored (if present).

### P3 · SCHEMA.md *(the constitution)*
- **TEACH** — this one file makes the agent a consistent librarian; it's the
  product.
- **TAILOR** — confirm the frontmatter fields and naming convention.
- **TEACH (architecture)** — also explain, in plain words, the memory model: the
  in-folder `memory/` is the **portable brain**, `tools/` is the **self-arming
  toolbox**, and the harness memory is for **machine-specific** facts only — so
  moving the folder preserves behaviour. This is what the entrypoints encode.
- **BUILD** — write a tailored `SCHEMA.md` **by filling `templates/SCHEMA.md`**
  (don't invent the structure): layers + folder map; file naming; the frontmatter
  spec; the **ingest / query / lint / compile / healthcheck** recipes; the privacy
  + credential rules. Self-describing. Then generate the **agent entrypoints** by
  copying **`templates/AGENTS.md`** + **`templates/CLAUDE.md`** and adapting every
  `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` to this project (name, owner, categories, skills,
  `memory/` path). These wire the KB into the harness.
- **VERIFY** — read the key sections; confirm an agent opening the folder would
  load `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, learn the memory/tools model, and be oriented.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "this is the rulebook everything follows — happy?"
- **LOG** — `P3 · wrote SCHEMA.md + AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md (from templates)`.
- **Done when:** `SCHEMA.md` covers layers, naming, frontmatter, and the five core
  recipes; `AGENTS.md` (+ `CLAUDE.md` pointer) exist, adapted, and describe
  memory/tools.

### P4 · Seed the portable brain
- **TEACH** — `memory/` is the *portable brain*: a **cross-linked graph** of
  durable facts about working this KB — conventions, gotchas, solutions — tuned
  for *method* the way `kb/` is tuned for *matter*. It travels with the folder and
  **grows** as the system is used (the self-arming loop feeds it from `daily/`).
- **TAILOR** — ask for 2–4 starting facts (summary style, "ask before inferring",
  what to always flag, any known gotcha for this domain).
- **BUILD** — write each as a one-fact file with frontmatter (`type` from the
  ontology in §C, `tags`, and any `related`/`applies-to`/`implemented-by`
  `[[links]]`) + body, and **cross-link** related facts, kb pages, or tools.
  Update `memory/index.md` as the graph's entry point. Note that `compile-memory`
  (if chosen) will later distil `daily/` logs into more facts **and tools**, and
  maintain the links.
- **VERIFY** — show the facts, their links, and the index.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "these shape *how* I work for you here — anything to add?"
- **LOG** — `P4 · seeded N brain facts (linked)`.
- **Done when:** ≥2 typed fact files + `memory/index.md` exist, with at least one
  cross-link.

### P5 · First real ingest *(prove the loop)*
- **TEACH** — run the real pipeline on one real document, narrating each step.
- **TAILOR** — ask the user to drop **one** real document in `inbox/`. If they have
  nothing ready (or it's a format you can't read — note which extension covers it),
  offer to proceed with a **synthetic sample** (a stand-in invoice, letter, or
  article) just to demonstrate the flow, marking it clearly so it can be removed.
- **BUILD** — run the ingest recipe live: **consult `memory/` and `tools/index.md`
  first** (known conventions, gotchas, or a tool that already handles this kind of
  source) → read & classify → surface anything notable → rename+move into
  `raw/<category>/` → write the `kb/sources/` page → roll up into entity/topic
  pages → append `kb/log.md`, and a brief observation to today's `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` →
  update `kb/index.md`. Confirm at each write.
- **VERIFY** — open the source page and the updated index together.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "that's one full ingest — clear how it flowed?"
- **LOG** — `P5 · first ingest: <source>`.
- **Done when:** the source is in `raw/`, has a `kb/sources/` page, and the index
  links it.

### P6 · First real query *(prove retrieval)*
- **TEACH** — the synthesis, not re-reading raw files, answers questions.
- **TAILOR** — ask a real question the new source can answer.
- **BUILD** — answer by reading `kb/index.md` then the relevant pages; cite them;
  offer to save to `kb/queries/`; append a one-line observation to today's
  `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (what was asked, which pages answered it, any gap noticed) —
  this is what feeds `/compile`.
- **VERIFY** — confirm the answer is grounded in cited pages.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "retrieval works end to end — see how it used the wiki?"
- **LOG** — `P6 · first query`.
- **Done when:** a cited answer is produced from the synthesis.

### P7 · Build the core skills *(+ the self-arming loop)*
- **TEACH** — skills turn the recipes into one-word commands. The five core skills
  are `/ingest`, `/query`, `/lint`, **`/compile`** (distils `daily/` → `memory/`
  facts + `tools/` scripts — the on-demand self-arming loop), and
  **`/healthcheck`** (audits the running system and writes an HTML report —
  *machinery*, where `/lint` checks *content*).
- **TAILOR** — reconfirm the skill list; pick the next one.
- **BUILD** — scaffold each skill from its recipe in `SCHEMA.md`, wired to the
  conventions. Confirm each file. For `/compile`, reuse the on-demand core of the
  `compile-memory` build prompt; for `/healthcheck`, build the system audit that
  renders a self-contained (inline-CSS, no external assets) HTML report to
  `reports/healthcheck-YYYY-MM-DD.html`, **styled from `templates/design/`** (the
  Basel design template — or the user's `design/` tokens if `design-system` is added). Then **refresh `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`**
  so they list the new commands (as a `- /name — one-line` list).
- **VERIFY** — smoke-test `/ingest` and `/query`; then **close the loop once**:
  run `/compile` over the P5/P6 `daily/` entries and confirm it produced at least
  one `memory/` fact or `tools/` script; run `/healthcheck` and open the report.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "your core commands run, the loop closed once, and the system
  can check itself — good?"
- **LOG** — `P7 · built core skills: ingest query lint compile healthcheck`.
- **Done when:** each core skill exists and smoke-tests; `/compile` has distilled
  ≥1 fact/tool; `/healthcheck` produced a report; entrypoints list all five.

### P8 · Wire the chosen extensions
- **TEACH** — extensions attach at the edges; restate the **trust boundary**
  (inbound pulls; outbound is generic/redacted; never fuse them).
- **TAILOR** — take only the extensions chosen in P1, one at a time; for each,
  confirm its **Needs** and **Secrets** (ensure the var names are in
  `.env.example` and the user has filled `.env`).
- **BUILD** — scaffold each from its **`extensions.md` build prompt**, wired to
  `SCHEMA.md`; load any secrets from `.env`. For any **background tool** (watcher,
  scheduler), don't stop at creating the script: **register it to autostart by
  filling the matching `templates/schedulers/` template** (a *watcher* —
  `launchd-watcher.plist` / `Type=simple` unit — for a long-running process, or a
  *timer* — `launchd-timer.plist` / `systemd.service`+`.timer` / `crontab.txt` — for
  a periodic job; per the preflight OS, with a log path), **start it**, have its
  script **write a heartbeat + record its `interval` in the manifest** each run, and
  **record it in `tools/index.md` and the manifest** with its start/stop/status
  commands. (Re-)register idempotently — unregister-then-register — so a re-run
  never double-loads. Raise `tier` as extensions come online, and **refresh
  `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`** with the new commands.
  - **On failure** — if an extension won't scaffold or a service won't start,
    **stop and report it**, then offer to (a) **retry**, (b) **skip and continue**
    with the next extension, or (c) **abort and roll back** this extension's
    changes. Never leave a half-wired extension recorded as live in the manifest.
- **VERIFY** — demonstrate each wired extension once (idempotent re-run); for a
  background tool, run its **status** command, show it is actually running, **and
  confirm it is boot-persistent** (plist has `RunAtLoad` / unit is `enabled` / cron
  line present) — running now isn't enough. Then run `/healthcheck` and confirm the
  service shows green.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "each integration you wanted is proven, boot-persistent where
  it's a service, and green in `/healthcheck` — anything missing?"
- **LOG** — `P8 · wired extensions: […] · services running+persistent · tier=<…>`.
- **Done when:** each chosen extension runs once successfully; **every background
  tool is registered, started, boot-persistent, writing a heartbeat, and reports
  `running` via its status command**; `tools/index.md` + manifest list them;
  entrypoints updated; `/healthcheck` is green; no secret values in any tracked file.

### P9 · Lint, health-check + self-document
- **TEACH** — two passes keep things honest: `/lint` checks the *content* (the
  store), `/healthcheck` checks the *machinery* (the running system). Then the
  system explains itself to your future self.
- **TAILOR** — confirm lint scope and that a `README` is wanted.
- **BUILD** — run `/lint` (contradictions, orphans, staleness, missing links,
  gaps) → dated report in `kb/queries/`. Run `/healthcheck` as a **progress check**
  (not a gate): review the report together and **log any amber/red items** to fix
  now or carry as known gaps — P10 is where green is required. Fill
  **`kb/overview.md`** with a short in-folder scope/dashboard (what this KB covers,
  its categories and key entities). Generate `README.md` (what it is, how to use the
  skills, decisions — summarised from `CHANGELOG.log`). Confirm `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`
  reflect the final skill + extension set.
- **VERIFY** — review the lint report, the health-check report, and the README
  together.
- **CHECKPOINT** — "the system documents and checks itself now — does it read
  right, and are the health-check's flagged items understood?"
- **LOG** — `P9 · lint + healthcheck + README`.
- **Done when:** a lint report and a `/healthcheck` report exist (its flagged items
  reviewed and either fixed or logged), `kb/overview.md` is filled, and `README.md`
  describes the live system. *(Green is the P10 gate, not here.)*

### P10 · Handoff
- **TEACH** — recap the whole system in plain words: the two memories (the
  document store + the portable brain `memory/`), the toolbox `tools/` and its
  run-state, the machine-memory split (so the folder is portable), folders,
  skills, extensions, and tier.
- **TAILOR** — ask what they want to do first on their own.
- **BUILD** — **automatically run `/healthcheck` as the final acceptance gate** —
  every build ends with a full self-audit — and present the fresh
  `reports/healthcheck-YYYY-MM-DD.html` to the user. If it isn't green, walk the
  flagged items, fix them (or log them as known gaps with the user's OK), and
  re-run until it passes. Then a first `git commit` of the built system; set
  `last_phase: P10` in the manifest.
- **VERIFY** — open the green health-check report and walk `CHANGELOG.log` top to
  bottom together.
- **CHECKPOINT** — confirm they can run an ingest and a query unaided, and that the
  final `/healthcheck` reports green.
- **LOG** — `P10 · handoff · system live · healthcheck=green · tier=<…>`.
- **Done when:** the overall definition of done (§D) holds **and the build's final
  automatic `/healthcheck` is green** (or its residual items are logged and
  accepted).

## G · Maturity tiers

The system grows in stages; the manifest tracks where it is:

1. **Starter** — core only: ingest, query, lint, **compile, healthcheck**.
   Offline. The default delivery — and already **self-arming on demand** (you run
   `/compile`) and **self-verifying on demand** (`/healthcheck`).
2. **Connected** — inbound feeds + outbound consumption (email, drive, research…).
3. **Automated** — it maintains itself: the same compile/healthcheck/ingest loop,
   now **fired automatically** by hooks + a scheduler (cron, backup) instead of by
   hand. The Automated tier adds *when it runs*, not *what it does*.
4. **Intelligent** — it reasons over itself (sub-agents, reconciliation, search).

Adding an extension raises the tier. Don't push a user up a tier they didn't ask
for — offer the next rung, let them choose.

## H · `CHANGELOG.log` format

Append-only. One entry per LOG beat. Terse, but always the *why*.

```
[2026-01-15 14:32] P2 · scaffold
  built:   .gitignore, inbox/, raw/{contracts,receipts}/, kb/{…}, git init
  why:     three-layer store; secrets fenced before any sensitive data exists
  next:    P3 — write the tailored SCHEMA.md
```

Rules: newest at the bottom; never edit past entries; reverse a decision with a
*new* entry, not by rewriting history. Update `amanu.yaml` alongside each entry.

**Commit each phase.** At every **LOG** beat (after the manifest update), make a
git commit — message `[P<N>] <phase>` with the CHANGELOG line as the body — so the
build history is auditable and a resume has clean checkpoints to fall back to.
(Skip only if the preflight found no `git`.) Never `git push` without explicit
approval; secrets never reach a commit (rule 9).

## I · Quick-start

Give your agent one of these:

> **Fresh build —** *"Read `build-with-agent.md` and start the guided build with
> me at Phase 0. One phase at a time, explain before you do, confirm before you
> write, keep the `CHANGELOG.log`."*

> **Resume —** *"Read `build-with-agent.md` and `amanu.yaml`, tell me where we
> left off, and continue from `last_phase`."*

The agent drives; you steer. By Phase 10 you have a working, self-documenting
knowledge base at the tier you chose — and you understand every part because you
built it together.
